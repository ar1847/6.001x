 Computer Chooses a Word
**Part B is dependent on your functions from ps4a.py, so be sure to complete ps4a.py before working on ps4b.py**

Now that you have completed your word game code, you decide that you would like to enable your computer (SkyNet) to play the game (your hidden agenda is to prove once and for all that computers are inferior to human intellect!) In Part B you will make a modification to the playHand function from part A that will enable this to happen. The idea is that you will be able to compare how you as a user succeed in the game compared to the computer's performance.

It is your responsibility to create the function compChooseWord(hand, wordList, n). Pseudocode is provided in the file ps4b.py.

If you follow the pseudocode, you'll create a computer player that is legal, but not always the best. Once you've implemented it following our approach, feel free to try your own approach! As much as we'd love to give you credit for making an improved compChooseWord function, we hope you can understand our automatic grading facilities are limited in their ability to accept differing solutions. 

Test Cases

Some test cases to look at:

>>> compChooseWord({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6)
appels
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5)
acta
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)
immanent
>>> compChooseWord({'x': 2, 'z': 2, 'q': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)
None

For the first test case your code might also find apples, depending on how you code your solution. This is okay and will check as correct.
