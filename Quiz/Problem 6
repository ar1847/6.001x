 Problem 6

Write a function to flatten a list. The list contains other lists, strings, or ints. For example, [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5] is flattened into [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

def flatten(aList):
    ''' 
    aList: a list 
    Returns a copy of aList, which is a flattened version of aList 
    '''
  


Click to expand Hint: How to think about this problem

Paste your entire function, including the definition, in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements. Note that we ask you to write a function only -- you cannot rely on any variables defined outside your function for your code to work correctly.

    al1 = []

    return al1
