 Problem 6-2

You change your mind, and now want the behavior as described in Part 1, except that you want:

>>> ae.say('the sky is blue')
eric says: It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue

>>> ae.lecture('the sky is blue')
It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue

Change the definition of ArrogantProfessor so that the behavior described above is achieved.

Paste ONLY your ArrogantProfessor class in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements.

For this question, you will not be able to see the test cases we run. This problem will test your ability to come up with your own test cases.
