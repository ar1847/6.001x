Problem 4 - Part 2

Write a function called longestRun, which takes as a parameter a list of integers named L (assume L is not empty). This function returns the length of the longest run of monotonically increasing numbers occurring in L. A run of monotonically increasing numbers means that a number at position k+1 in the sequence is either greater than or equal to the number at position k in the sequence.

For example, if L = [10, 4, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 2] then your function should return the value 5 because the longest run of monotonically increasing integers in L is [3, 4, 5, 7, 7].

You may find it useful to use the function getSublists as defined above but you do not have to use this function. If you do use getSublists, the graders will use our implementation for getSublists. In the box for this problem, only paste the definition for the function longestRun.
Hint if you are Using getSublists

Your function does not have to be recursive. Do not leave any debugging print statements when you paste your code in the box.
