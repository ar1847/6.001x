 Problem 6-3

You change your mind once more. You want to keep the behavior from Part 2, but now you would like:

>>> pe.say('the sky is blue')
Prof. eric says: I believe that eric says: the sky is blue 

>>> ae.say('the sky is blue')
Prof. eric says: It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue 

Change the Professor class definition in order to achieve this.

Paste ONLY the one class that you changed in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements.

For this question, you will not be able to see the test cases we run. This problem will test your ability to come up with your own test cases.
