'''
The function recurPower(base, exp) from Problem 2 computed

by decomposing the problem into one recursive case and one base case:

Another way to solve this problem just using multiplication (and remainder) is to note that

Write a procedure recurPowerNew which recursively computes exponentials using this idea.

def recurPowerNew(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0

    returns: int or float; base^exp
    '''
    # Your code here
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    elif exp % 2 == 0:
        return recurPowerNew(base*base, exp/2)
    else:
        return(base * recurPowerNew(base, exp-1))
