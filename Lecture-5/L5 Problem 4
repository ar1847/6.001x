'''
The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,

    gcd(2, 12) = 2

    gcd(6, 12) = 6

    gcd(9, 12) = 3

    gcd(17, 12) = 1

Write an iterative function, gcdIter(a, b), that implements this idea. One easy way to do this is to begin with a test value equal to the smaller of the two input arguments, and iteratively reduce this test value by 1 until you either reach a case where the test divides both a and b without remainder, or you reach 1.

def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    # Your code here
    s = min(a,b)
    l = max(a,b)
    while s>1:
        if l%s == 0 and min(a,b)%s == 0:
            break
        else:
            s-=1
    return s
