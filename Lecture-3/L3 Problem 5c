3. Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

21

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable end. Our automating testing will provide a value of end for you - so write your code in the following box assuming end is already defined.

total=0
for num in range (1, end+1):
    total += num
print total
